The AI engineer continued development on HayvanPazarı, a mobile-first animal marketplace, addressing critical Authentication Integration Failure and listing creation issues. Initial attempts to fix React Native Web compatibility for  and  in  were challenging, leading to multiple debugging cycles. A major breakthrough was bypassing UI interaction issues to confirm backend functionality and later fixing both frontend button clicks (using web-compatible ) and backend JWT validation, allowing successful listing creation. The backend's MongoDB ID mapping was also corrected for proper listing retrieval and detail display. Extensive animal breed data was integrated backend-side, and frontend UI elements were added. Currently, the engineer is processing new UI designs provided via Google Stitch, having extracted the design system and initiated implementation by creating  and planning  updates.

<product_requirements>
HayvanPazarı is a mobile-first (PWA) livestock marketplace enabling sellers to post detailed animal listings (age, breed, health, certifications, location, transport, pricing) and buyers to filter extensively (type, breed, price, age, location). It supports multiple user roles (Buyer, Seller, Vet, Transporter, Admin) with email/password + OTP (mock) login, Seller KYC, detailed profiles, in-app messaging, offer/counter-offer, and logistics planning (escrow/payments and AI features are deferred). The UI should be user-friendly, like Letgo, and mobile-responsive. The tech stack is React Native/Expo (frontend), FastAPI/MongoDB (backend), JWT for auth, and planned WebSockets for real-time features. Current development has focused on core auth, listing CRUD, profile updates with Turkey city/district data, and message handling, with recent work integrating detailed animal breed data.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was tasked with implementing a new UI design provided by the user via Google Stitch. The engineer successfully downloaded, unzipped, and analyzed the provided design assets, including screenshots and HTML code snippets. A detailed design system analysis was performed, identifying core aesthetic components like the primary color (), typography (Plus Jakarta Sans), layout principles (modern, minimal, card-based), and component styles (rounded buttons, elevated cards). As the first step in applying this new design, the AI created a new file, , to centralize these design tokens. The next stated action is to begin applying these design changes to .
